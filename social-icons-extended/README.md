This plugins extends WordPress's "social icons" block to add additional icons:

## Usage

1. Run `yarn install` to install everything. You can use `npm` if you prefer, but it was built with `yarn`
2. Run `yarn build` which will use `@wordpress/scripts` to build the package.
3. During development you can either `symlink` it to your `plugins` folder or just copy the entire thing.
4. For production use, just zip up `build` and `social-icons-extended.php`
